## 1. Installation. 

There is necessary libraries to run the code beyond the Anaconda distribution  
(numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot,  KMeans from klearn.cluster, StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing) . 
The code can run using Python versions 3.

## 2. Project Motivation. 

For this project, I used data of Airbnb house in Seattle and Boston (downloaded from <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">here</a>).  
The purpose of the analysis here is to answer the questions below: 

- What are the important elements for hosts/rooms to be booked maltiple times?
- Waht is the price range of hosts/rooms booked maltiple times?
- What are the features of host/rooms with higher review score?

## 3. File Descriptions. 

I analyzed the data in <b>airbnb_data_analytics.ipynb</b>.
I used clusterinig to answer the question 1, histogram for the question 2 and graph chart for question 3.  
I put some comment on Markdown cells to make it easier that the viewer can go through the codes.

## 4. Results. 

The findings and the details of answers are described in <a href="https://medium.com/@seim14n.222/features-of-airbnb-rooms-booked-multiple-times-in-seattle-and-boston-f233e2fab07d">my blog</a> 

## 5. Licensing, Authors, and Acknowledgements. 

Must give credit to Airbinb for the data. The data is available <a href="http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html">here</a>.  
Otherwise, please feel free to use the code, and hopefully I can get kind feedback to develop my skills from anyone!!
